# 👁️ Eye Lab: Gaze Tracker API

Eye Lab is an open-source tool to create eye-tracking usability tests. It started as a final undergraduate work for the Computer Engineering student [Karine Pistili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karine-pistili/) who made the prototype. The idea is to evolve it into a more complete and useful tool with the community's help.

The current version of the software allows users to create their usability sessions of a website, recording the webcam, screen, and mouse movements and use this information to find out where the user has been looking into the screen by using heatmaps.

## 👩‍💻 Setting up project locally

The project consists of two parts, this repository contains the backend of the application, and the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/uramakilab/web-eye-tracker-front). Install it as well to have the full application running.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment


#### **Linux & macOS**
##### **Step 1: Create a virtual environment**
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
```


##### **Step 2: Activate the virtual environment**
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

##### **Step 3: Install dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### **Step 4: Run Flask**
```sh
flask run
```

---

#### **Windows**
##### **Step 1: Create a virtual environment**
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

##### **Step 2: Activate the virtual environment**
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

##### **Step 3: Install dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### **Step 4: Run Flask**
```sh
flask run
```

---

### **2. Using Conda (Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows)**

#### **Step 1: Create a Conda virtual environment**
```sh
conda create --name flask_env python=3.10
```

#### **Step 2: Activate the environment**
```sh
conda activate flask_env
```

#### **Step 3: Install dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Step 4: Run Flask**
```sh
flask run
```


### **Additional Notes**
- If you face issues running `flask run`, try:

  ```sh
  python -m flask run
  ```
- If Flask is not installed, install it manually:

  ```sh
  pip install flask
  ```
- On **Windows**, if `venv\Scripts\activate` doesn't work, **run PowerShell as Administrator** and enable scripts:

  ```sh
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
  ```
